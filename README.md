# hello-world
getting started with github new
I have a bunch of software bits, Arduino sketches mostly, that I'll put here.  
At the same time I want to create repositories maybe a UserID for my robotics club.  
So this is looking around to see what is the best to do.  
We have had several instances were version control accross several club members has been an issue!
